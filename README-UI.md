==================

The project uses React+Redux using [this project](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) as the base. Refer to their docs for more.

Usage
-----

Before delving into the descriptions of each available npm script, here's a brief summary of the three which will most likely be your bread and butter:

* Doing live development? Use `npm start` to spin up the dev server.
* Compiling the application to disk? Use `npm run compile`.
* Deploying to an environment? `npm run deploy` can help with that.

**NOTE:** This package makes use of [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) to improve your debugging experience. For convenience, all of messages are prefixed with `app:*`. If you'd like to to change what debug statements are displayed, you can override the `DEBUG` environment variable via the CLI (e.g. `DEBUG=app:* npm start`) or tweak the npm scripts (`betterScripts` in `package.json`).

Great, now that introductions have been made here's everything in full detail:

|`npm run...`|Description|
|---|---|
|`start`|Spins up Koa server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon to automatically restart the server when server-related code is changed.|
|`dev:nw`|Same as `npm run dev`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.|
|`dev:no-debug`|Same as `npm run dev` but disables redux devtools.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`deploy:dev`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`deploy:prod`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`flow:check`|Analyzes the project for type errors.|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).|

**NOTE:** Deploying to a specific environment? Make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` so webpack will use the correct configuration. For example: `NODE_ENV=production npm run compile` will compile your application with `~/config/_production.js`.

### Configuration

Basic project configuration can be found in `~/config/_base.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your `src` and `dist` directories, adjust compilation settings, tweak your vendor dependencies, and more. For the most part, you should be able to make changes in here **without ever having to touch the webpack build configuration**.

If you need environment-specific overrides (useful for dynamically setting API endpoints, for example), create a file with the name of target `NODE_ENV` prefixed by an `_` in `~/config` (e.g. `~/config/_production.js`). This can be entirely arbitrary, such as `NODE_ENV=staging` where the config file is `~/config/_staging.js`.

Common configuration options:

|Key|Description|
|---|---|
|`dir_src`|application source code base path|
|`dir_dist`|path to build compiled application to|
|`server_host`|hostname for the Koa server|
|`server_port`|port for the Koa server|
|`compiler_css_modules`|whether or not to enable CSS modules|
|`compiler_devtool`|what type of source-maps to generate (set to `false`/`null` to disable)|
|`compiler_vendor`|packages to separate into to the vendor bundle|

#### API URL
The API URL can be set on `src/Api.js`
